## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

```






```{r}
library(readxl)
lac_data <- read_excel("data/lac_data.xlsx")
print()


lac_data %>%
  filter(time == "pre") %>%
  select(FP, sex, age, weight, height) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(MeanAge = mean(age),
            sdAge = sprintf("(%.2f)", sd(age)),
            MeanHeight = mean(height),
            sdHeight = sprintf("(%.2f)", sd(height)),
            MeanWeight = mean(weight),
            sdWeight = sprintf("(%.2f)", sd(weight)), n = n()) %>%
  gt(caption = "Subjects") %>%
  cols_label(MeanAge = "Age",
             sdAge = "",
             MeanHeight = "Height",
             sdHeight = "",
             MeanWeight = "Weight",
             sdWeight = "",
             n = "Participants",
             sex = "Sex") %>%
